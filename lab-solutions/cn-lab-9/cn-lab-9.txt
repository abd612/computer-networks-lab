1. Src IP: 10.5.0.107

2. Protocol: ICMP (1)

3. Header: 20 bytes, Total: 56 bytes, Payload: Total - Header = 36 bytes

4. Not fragmented, since the more fragments bit in the flag is 0.

5. Identification, Time to live, Header checksum

6. Stay constant: version, header length, differentiated services, total length, flags, protocol, source, destination
   Must stay constant: version, header length, differentiated services, total length, flags, protocol, source, destination
   Must change: identification, time to live, header checksum

7. The value in the identification field increments with each subsequent IMCP echo request.

8. Identification: 0xff34 (65332), Time to live: 255

9. Identification changes as each packet has a distinct identity.
   Time to live remains unchanged as it is always same for first-hop router.

10. Packet:5036 has been fragmented across more than one datagrams.

11. More fragment flag bit is set indicating fragmentation. Zero fragment offset indicates first fragment. Total length is 1500 bytes.

12. Non-zero fragment offset indicates its not the first fragment. More fragment flag set to 0 indicates last fragment.

13. Total length, Flags (More fragments, Fragment offset), Header checksum

14. 3 fragments for Packet:7656

14. Total length, Flags (More fragments, Fragment offset), Header checksum
