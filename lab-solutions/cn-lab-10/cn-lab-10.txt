Part 1

1. Source IP: 10.5.0.107, Destination IP: 34.206.192.89

2. IMCP packet is used to communicate network level information between hosts, not processes.
   So port numbers are not required.

3. Type: 8, Code: 0
   Additional fields: Checksum, Identifier, Sequence number, Data
   Checksum: 2 bytes, Identifier: 2 bytes, Sequence number: 2 bytes

4. Type: 0, Code: 0
   Additional fields: Checksum, Identifier, Sequence number, Data
   Checksum: 2 bytes, Identifier: 2 bytes, Sequence number: 2 bytes

Part 2

5. Source IP: 10.5.0.107, Destination IP: 128.93.162.84

6. The protocol number would be that for UDP, i.e. 0x11 or 17

7. The IMCP echo packet is same as the IMCP ping query packet, except for data size.

8. The IMCP error packet has two additional fields containing IP header (20 bytes) and ICMP header (8 bytes) of the original packet

9. The last three packets are IMCP reply packets with type 0. They have reached the destination before getting expired.

10. No such in this case. But significantly longer delay would indicate cross-country link.
