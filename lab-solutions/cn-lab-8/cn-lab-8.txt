part 1

step 2

h - The browser loaded the page at www.osi.local

step 3

b - Layer 7: HTTP
	1. The HTTP client sends a HTTP request to the server.

c - Dest Port = 80

d - Dest IP = 192.168.1.2

e - Layer 2: Ehternet II Header 0030.A3EE.5422 >> 0060.3EEE.74E3

f - Source IP: 192.168.1.1, Dest IP: 192.168.1.2
	Layer 3

	Source Port: 1025, Dest Port: 80
	Layer 4

	Host: www.osi.local
	Layer 7

h - Differences:
	Layer 4: Source and Dest Ports are interchanged
	Layer 3: Source and Dest IPs are interchanged
	Layer 2: Source and Dest MACs are interchanged

i - HTTP DATA..

j - 2 tabs
	Since it is the last event in the stream of traffic, there's no Outbound PDU Details tab

part 2

step 1

b - DNS, ARP, TCP

d - NAME: www.osi.local

e - Device: PC0 (Client)
	ADDRESS: 192.168.1.2

f - 4. The TCP connection is successful.
	5. The device sets the connection state to ESTABLISHED.

g - This event closed the connection
	4. The device sets the connection state to CLOSED.

challenge

Web Server listening at Port: 80 for web request
Web Server listening at Port: 53 for DNS request

conclusion

The purpose of this lab was to investigate the TCP/IP and OSI models in action topology.
The first part consisted of examining the HTTP web traffic.
We learned how to switch from realtime to simulation mode, generate web (HTTP) traffic and explore the contents of the HTTP packet.
We saw the PDU details of various events and visualized their encapsulation in OSI model.
The second part consisted of displaying elements of the TCP/IP protocol suite.
We learned how to view the additional events.
We saw the additional types of DNS, ARP, TCP and examined their details.
Lastly, through the challenge, we found the different ports the server listens at for different requests.
